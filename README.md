<h2>UX</h2>
This website is for a Forever Young, with in this website i wanted to be a simplistic website and that can be easily navigateda around it.

In this project I have provided that by making a singpel page website with most off the features that I have learned, the header allows you to flow easy throught the website
so you don't have to scroll down to the area, meaning that you can just click the bottom and it will take you to the area that you want to see.

I added a pricing list so that they don't have to ask us how the system works it's displayed to them just by a click of a button.

<h2>Features</h2>
When you open open the website the first thing you will see is a carousel with flowing images of people exercising

If you scroll down you will come across 2 reviews that we have showcased on the website for people to read and see what there experience was like after being with us for 3 months.

Then you will reach the pricing list that showcases 3 different packages off what they have to offer for you, the 3 main packages are Starter, Advanced, Pro, they do display on the price listing what benefits you get from getting these packages anywhere from 5 free open sessions to having a discount at the at the cafe.

And fianlly you at the bottom you will reach the contat us page that show's you everything you need to conact them, they display there Email, location, Meet up location, Office location and phone number.
